# slack deploy bot

An e2e whitelabeled humanlayer integration to help out with deployments

## Capabilities

- promote a vercel deployment in the production app
- push a git tag to the production repo

## Usage

### Promote a vercel deployment

```
user
---
@deploybot promote the last web commit to production
```

```
deploybot
---
agent deploy bot needs approval to run function vercel-deploy

function: vercel-deploy

## Tools

- list vercel deployments (use the vercel sdk)
- promote vercel deployment
- list git tags on production repo
- list git commits on production repo
- push a git tag to the production repo
- done_for_now

## HumanLayer integration points

- init workflow from slack (this feature does not exist!), see humanlayer/humanlayer - humanlayer/models_agent_webhook.py


## Agent architecture notes

- baml agent in got-agents repo
- typescript / express (okay fine pick whatever node webserver you want)

## outer loop

cases in which the agent starts a new workflow without human intervention:

### PR merged and all tests passed

```
deploybot
---
deploybot: PR #135 merged and all tests passed, do you want to deploy?
|Respond| |Yes|
```

-> respond "yes"

```
deploybot
---
agent deploybot needs approval to run function git-tag

function: git-tag
commit: 131e39d
date: 2025-03-07
message: merge PR #135 "improve slack webhook verification"
author: sundeep
previous_tag: v0.3.81 
new_tag: v0.3.82

|Approve| |Reject|
```

-> approve

```
deploybot
---
agent deploybot needs approval to run function vercel-deploy

function: vercel-deploy
commit: 131e39d
message: merge PR #135 "improve slack webhook verification"
author: sundeep

|Approve| |Reject|
```

-> approve

### Undeployed Changes

```
deploybot
---
deploybot: There are unstaged changes in the production repo, do you want to deploy? They include:

- 1eea39d refactor org routes
- a39d1ee fix bug in projects dropdown


|Respond| |Yes|
```

-> respond "yes"

... etc etc do both things again

## Prompt drafts

### Inbound message

when an inbound message is sent by a user, the agent will use this prompt

*System Message*

```
You are a helpful assistant that can help with software deployment tasks.

Your team is structured as follows:

### Overview
- engineers hang out in the #engineering channel in slack. 
- engineers work in a single monorepo, metalytics-dev/metalytics
- the repo contains both frontend and backend code

### Frontend
- frontend deployments are managed in vercel. On merge, the frontend will automatically deploy to the humanlayer-app-development environment - this is a staging/preview environment.
- 

### Backend

You have the following capabilities:

- list vercel deployments
- promote a vercel deployment
- list git tags on production repo
- list git commits on production repo
- push a git tag to the production repo

You can help with the following tasks

-
-
-

```

*User Message*

The user message will be whatever message was sent by the user in slack

```
{{user_message}}
```

### Daily check for stale commits

the bot will check daily (twice daily!?) for stale commits on the production repo.
This means commits that have been merged but not deployed to production.

*System Message*

This uses the same system prompt as above, but with a different user message

*User Message*

```
you are doing your daily check for stale commits.

The current time is {{current_time}}

the last few git commits are:

{% for commit in git_commits %}
<commit>
message: {{commit.message}} 
date: {{commit.date}} 
author: {{commit.author}} 
sha: {{commit.sha}} 
tags: {{commit.tags}}
</commit>
{% endfor %}

the last few vercel deployments in production are:

{% for deployment in vercel_deployments %}
<deployment>
name: {{deployment.name}}
url: {{deployment.url}}
status: {{deployment.status}} # Preview, Staged, Current
created_at: {{deployment.created_at}}
</deployment>
{% endfor %}

You should always message users first if you want to recommend deploying, for example:

<example>
Hey {{user_name}}, I noticed that there are 3 commits in main that haven't been deployed to production yet.

shall we deploy the latest?
</example>

```

## Environment Variables

The deploybot requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub API token for accessing GitHub's API
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: GitHub repository owner
- `GITHUB_REPO`: GitHub repository name
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel API token for accessing Vercel's API
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Vercel project ID
- `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`: Vercel team ID (optional)
- `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Secret for verifying webhook signatures
- `HUMANLAYER_API_KEY`: API key for HumanLayer service
- `REDIS_CACHE_URL`: Redis connection URL for caching
- `DEFAULT_SLACK_CHANNEL`: Default Slack channel ID for notifications

## Installation

To set up the deploybot:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the dotenv.example file to .env and fill in the required environment variables
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Build the project with `npm run build`
5. Start the server with `npm start`

For development:
- Use `npm run dev` for hot-reloading during development

### Testing locally

To test the local development setup:

1. Copy `Makefile.local.example` to `Makefile.local` and customize with your Slack workspace details
2. Run test commands using `make test-curl-new-thread` or `make test-curl-list-vercel-deployments`

This approach keeps your local testing configuration separate from the main Makefile, preventing accidental commits of your personal settings.

## Deployment

The deploybot can be deployed using:

1. Docker: Use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml
2. Render: Configuration is available in render.yaml
3. Any Node.js hosting service that supports Express applications

## Security Considerations

- Keep your API keys and tokens secure
- Use HTTPS for all production deployments
- Verify webhook signatures to prevent unauthorized requests
- Limit access to deployment functions to authorized users only
- Regularly rotate API keys and tokens

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Webhook verification fails**: Check that your WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET matches the one configured in Slack
- **GitHub API rate limiting**: Implement caching or reduce the frequency of API calls
- **Vercel deployment errors**: Verify your Vercel tokens and project IDs are correct
- **Redis connection issues**: Ensure Redis is running and accessible at the configured URL
